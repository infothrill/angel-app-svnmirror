Getting the latest source
-------------------------
$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/angel-app/trunk/angel-app
This will download the latest development source tree (which might be broken)

Installing
----------
See http://angelapp.missioneternity.org/index.py/Documentation/Install

Below is just a mini-summary of how to install (both methods require setuptools).

Unsafe install (will probably write into the python site-packages directory),
can optionally be appended with a --prefix option
	$ python setup.py install

Safe install (existing site-packages won't be changed):
	$ python bootstrap.py $TARGETDIRECTORY

the latter will install a virtual-python installation in 
$TARGETDIRECTORY and install the angel packages there. 
this guarantees easy de-installation and avoidance of python
package conflicts.

Angel may then be launched by
	$ cd angel-app/bin
	$ ./python ./master.py

see also the README file for alternative ways to start Angel.
