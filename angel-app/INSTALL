Unsafe install:

python setup.py install

Safe install:

python bootstrap.py

the latter will install a virtual-python installation in 
$PWD/angel-app and install the angel-app packages there. 
this guarantees easy de-installation and avoidance of package conflicts.

the angel-app may then be launched by
$ cd angel-app/bin
$ ./python ./master.py

see also the README file for alternative ways to start the angel-app.
