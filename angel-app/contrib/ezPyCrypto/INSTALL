To install this software, you'll need Python 2.2 or later - available from:
http://www.python.org

Step By Step Instructions:

1) Ensure you have Python 2.2 or later installed

2) Install the PyCrypto backend. You can do this in 3 ways:

   (i)   If running windoze, and Python 2.2, just run the
         installer - pycrypto-1.9a4.win32-py2.2.exe, OR

   (ii)  If running Debian GNU/Linux, log in as root and
         type 'apt-get install python-crypto', OR

   (iii) Go into the directory 'pycrypto-1.9a4', log in with
         admin privilege, then type:

              python setup.py install

         (you'll need to have a suitable C compiler installed)

3) Now install ezPyCrypto. In the top level directory (where
   this INSTALL file is residing), log in with admin privileges
   and type:

      python setup.py install

From now, you can just run the example programs,
read the manual, and be up and running in minutes.

When running the examples, make sure you run them in strict
order. Some later examples use files created by earlier examples.
