This directory contains ezPyCrypto - Python Cryptography
reduced to absolute simplicity.

To use ezPyCrypto, you'll first need to install PyCrypto.

To simplify this step, I've included  PyCrypto 1.9a4 with
this distribution (invoking my rights under the GNU
General Public License).

Source code for PyCrypto is in the 'pycrypto-1.9a4' directory.
(I've also included a Windows installer EXE for PyCrypto,
in case you're on Windows and don't have a suitable compiler,
or are just feeling lazy).

If you feel untrusting (good attitude in this field!), you
might want to get the official PyCrypto for yourself, just
go to the PyCrypto website:
http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html

If you've got Python 2.2 or later installed, and PyCrypto
installed properly as well, you should be able to just
run each of the examples IN ORDER.

Note that when you get your Python application working, you
can bundle it into a standalone EXE file fit for distribution,
that doesn't need anything else (not even Python). To create
such an EXE file, vist:

Refer to the INSTALL file for more info.
