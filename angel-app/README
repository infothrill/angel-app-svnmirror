RUNNING angel-app
------------------
Background: angel-app currently consists of 3 main programs, called
- maintainer (does the network maintenance loop)
- presenter  (provides local, private repository access)
- provider   (public network server)

To easily run all of these programs, angel-app currently provides
a wrapper program that controls the different parts. This program is
called 'master.py'.

To interactively run it, you usually to:
$ cd angel-app/bin
$ ./python ./master.py

This leaves you with a very cluttered terminal. To start angel-app in the
background (daemon mode), master.py provides an interface for starting, stopping
and also restarting:
$ cd angel-app/bin
$ ./python ./master.py -d start|stop|restart


CONFIGURATION
-------------
angel-app can be configured through a central configuration file which can be found
in $HOME/.angel_app/config. The file has is in the well known and widespread ini-style
syntax.

LOGGING
-------
In the default setup, angel-app logs all its output to $HOME/.angel_app/log/*.log
Each process has its own logfile called respectively presenter|provider|maintainer[.log]
If angel-app is started with master.py, there is an overall logfile, which contains
all messages from all components of angel-app. This logfile is called master.log.
