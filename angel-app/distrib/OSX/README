README file for deployment of a Mac OS X app bundle

this file is based on the creation of such a bundle on OS X 10.4 with a 
python2.4 framework package obtained from http://www.pythonmac.org/ and
an svn checkout of the current source code (Revision 474, Sat Mar  3 16:39:49 2007) 
of the angel-app.

1. make sure you have a current version of py2app as described in 
http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html#installation
if you're using an older macpython framework install, you might have to uninstall
your current py2app version (py2app-0.3.5 at the time of writing).

2. go to the root directory of your angel-app checkout

3. include the contrib and src directories in the python module search path
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/contrib/:$PWD/src/:$PYTHONPATH

4. run py2app, giving it all the toplevel scripts as arguments
$ py2applet ./src/bin/wxmaster.py ./src/bin/master.py ./src/bin/presenter.py ./src/bin/provider.py ./src/bin/maintainer.py

5. the referencing of the icon file is broken, in the Contents/Info.plist file, you'll find an entry
        <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>
        <string>master</string>
   while in fact there's only a PythonApplet.icns located in Contents/Resources. Specifying an icns on the
   command line seems to be similarly broken for me. Here's what i've found to work.
   -- Change the entry in the .plist file to:
        <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>
        <string>master.icns</string>
   -- copy the icon file from distrib/OSX/icons/m221e.icns to Contents/Resources/master.icns
      
5. rename the app bundle from wxmaster.app to angel.app. If you do this on the command line
$ mv master.app angel.app
the icon will also refresh.
      
DONE!
