README file for deployment of a Mac OS X app bundle

this file is based on the creation of such a bundle on OS X 10.4 with a 
python2.4 framework package obtained from http://www.pythonmac.org/ and
an svn checkout of the current source code (Revision 474, Sat Mar  3 16:39:49 2007) 
of the angel-app.

1. make sure you have a current version of py2app as described in 
http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html#installation
if you're using an older macpython framework install, you might have to uninstall
your current py2app version (py2app-0.3.5 at the time of writing).

2. go to the root directory of your angel-app checkout

3. include the contrib and src directories in the python module search path
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/contrib/:$PWDsrc/angel_app/:$PYTHONPATH

4. run py2app, giving it all the toplevel scripts as arguments
$ py2applet ./src/bin/master.py ./src/bin/presenter.py ./src/bin/provider.py ./src/bin/maintainer.py
