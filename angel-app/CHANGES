0.4.5 August 21 2009

 * on Mac OS X, the main window can now be closed without quitting the
   application
 * mounting missioneternity.org is not forced in a hidden way anymore. Instead,
   on GUI startup, a check is performed that asks the end-user if he wants to
   become an ANGEL by backing up missioneternity data
 * added menu Help->Version History
 * added angel_app.worker, which implements boiled down map/reduce functionality
 * html directory listing changed to be more independant of the
   missioneternity.org website (css) and made it look more like a "technical"
   listing as opposed to looking like being part of the website 
 * when syncing a collection that already exists, only sync the metadata
 * error handling refinements
 * optimized resource inspection by parallelizing network requests
 * optimized broadcast: parallelize broadcasting, essentially scaling O(1)
   instead of O(n). This saves about 1 hour per tree traversal right now.
   Also, only broadcasts to reachable clones that don't have the local node.
 * stability fixes in DirectoryDeadPropertyStore (file transactions and broken
   metadata)
 * optimized PROPPATCH: do not pingBack() to self
 * optimized PROPPATCH: use byte range based validation instead of full
   validation
 * optimized clone DNS resolution: resolve IP of local nodename, resolve all
   clone hostnames and check for IP doubles
 * added new config option to enable/disable parallelization in network requests,
   default on (common.workerforking = bool)
 * added new config variable in section 'common': 'repository-tmp'
   This variable holds absolute paths, is optional and only relevant if you
   put the repository on a different mount point than angelHome. Atomic file
   renames cannot be done cross-device.

0.4.4 July 4 2009

This release introduces major speed improvements in the maintenance algorithm
which should result in maintaining local replicas a lot quicker, while
preserving network resources during normal maintenance. 

In practice:

For desktop users, the maintenance process will find individual local broken
resources (e.g. also new resources / deleted resources) much faster than in
earlier versions. This only holds true if the sleep interval is small, e.g. if
the maintainer has just been started (by default, the maintainer will
incrementally adjust its speed of operation to fit into one day).

For server installation, e.g. long-running instances, it means that a lot less
traffic will be generated during the maintenance.  

Note: the initial sync is still slow, as each resource will get downloaded twice
for each node running (find+update)!

 * initial support for doing remote clone validation based on random chunks of
   data. Implemented using standard HTTP byte range headers. This should
   lead to MASSIVE bandwidth savings.
 * improvements in clone resolution: clones with numeric IP addresses are
   thrown away if a clone with a hostname resolving to this address exists.
 * mount now forces the remote clone to be saved locally, even if the initial
   inspection fails.
 * bugfix in maintenance: when no local clones are stored, recursively walk up
   the tree to find some
 * broadcasting of local clone to remote clones optimized (e.g. dropped
   reachability and existence checks, as broadcasting is allowed to fail).
 * improved KDE/Gnome support for opening the WebDAV repository.
 * optimized server side HEAD operation for directories by not computing a
   content listing.
 * logging: use format strings

0.4.3 May 22 2009

 Maintenance release, fixing a major bug in the network code.

 * bugfix in rate limiting: endless read() loop on remote disconnects
 * optimized pingBack(): resolve DNS entries before falling back to IP
 * tracker connections optimized
 * html directory listing slightly adapted

0.4.2 "pollination" May 15 2009

 Mainly a bugfix release, introducing download speed limitation as the only
 major change. Named after the etoy workshop that was held at pollinaria.org
 during May 9/10th 2009. 

 * added new option for limiting download speed, only active for actual
   data transfers, not active in the protocol itself
 * automatically timeout network connections in the maintainer
 * initial draft for quota support, not in action yet
 * switched to dyndnsc from http://pypi.python.org/
 * bugfix: treat broken meta data as if it did not exist
 * lots of small and minor bugfixes
 * removed final ZODB traces from the code
 * optimized logging (less IO, less CPU usage)
 * upgraded wxpython to 2.8.8.1 in mac os x build
 
0.4.1 "zhong guo" July 1 2008
 * bugfix: don't try unreachable clones in maintenance
 * bugfix: require a default crypto key

0.4.0 "zhong guo" June 14 2008
 * repository initialization moved to maintainer (from master)
 * replaced xattr metadata store with custom DeadPropertyStore; this removes
   the dependency of only supporting filesystems with extended attributes
 * GUI revamp, splash screen, menus
 * on Mac OS X, logs are now in ~/Library/Logs/Angel/ by default (on new install)
 * added Growl support on Mac OS X
 * mounting of external resources was moved to the maintainer loop, so that
   mounts will automatically be retried if they failed earlier
 * added built-in dynamic dns client to the provider loop (disabled by default);
   this adds new dependencies for the modules 'netifaces' and 'IPy' but allows
   better addressing. Manual configuration only.
 * minor changes (sometimes you win, sometimes you lose)
 * improved stability of maintenance loop
